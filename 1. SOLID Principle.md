## What is SOLID Principle

Its avoid the duplicate code in software design.when our codebase expand then its complexity should be lower otherwise it would hard to maintain the codebase.

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle

class should have only single reason to chnage

Let take an example of marker, we make markers and sold it to clients

```java
//marker.java

class Marker{
    String name;
    String color;
    int year;
    int price;

//constructor
    public Marker(  String name,String color,int year,int price){
        this.name = name;
        this.color = color;
        this.year = year;
        this.price = price;
    }
}

```

We need invoice for Marker sell so we will make another class

```java
// invoice.java

class Invoice{
//Invoice `HAS` a Marker
    private Marker marker;
    private int quantity;

    publci Invoice(Marker marker, int quantity){
        this.marker = marker;
        this.quantity = quantity;
    }

    //Method to calculate the price
    public int calculateTotal(){
        int price = ((marker.price)* this.quantity);
    }

    //method to print invoice
    public void printInvoice(){
        //print the Invoice
    }

    public void saveToDB(){
        //save to DB
    }
}

```

Reasons to change the `Invoice` class

1. we want to calculate the price of all marker that got sold, but with GST(Thanks to Modiji, mitrooo)
   so for this we need to modify the `calculateTotal` method. so Invoice class is getting change due to this method.

2. second reason can be to change the Invoice class is, suppose we need to `printInvoice` with someextra details then we need to change the method `printInvoice`.

3. third reason could be the, Instead of saving the Invoice into the DB, we want to save into the File System.

we can write this code in way where we need only one reason to make changes in `Invoice` class.

This `Invoice` class is only responsible for the `Price` of the marker, if make changes under the method `calculateTotal` then only `Invoice` class will get affected by this, remaining other class will same.

```java
// invoice.java

class Invoice{
//Invoice `HAS` a Marker
    private Marker marker;
    private int quantity;

//Constructor
    publci Invoice(Marker marker, int quantity){
        this.marker = marker;
        this.quantity = quantity;
    }

    //Method to calculate the price
    public int calculateTotal(){
        int price = ((marker.price)* this.quantity);
    }
}

```

For printing the `Invoice` we will make seprate class `InvoicePrinter` and for the saving the data we will make class `InvoiceDao` where Dao stands for `Data Access Layer`

```java

class InvoiceDao{
    Invoice invoice;

    public InvoiceDao(Invoice invoice){
        this.invoice = invoice;
    }

    public void saveToDB(){
        //save to DB
    }
}

```

```java
class InvoicePrinter{

    private Invoice invoice;

    public InvoicePrinter(Invoice invoice){
        this.invoice = invoice;
    }

     //method to print invoice
    public void printInvoice(){
        //print the Invoice
    }
}
```

### 2. Open-CLose Principle

> Open for Extension but close for Modification

Suppose we wanted to save the invoice into file along with DB so we can something like this, but keep in mind that Old code is already live and we are modifying it

```java

class InvoiceDao{
    Invoice invoice;

    public InvoiceDao(Invoice invoice){
        this.invoice = invoice;
    }

    public void saveToDB(){
        //save to DB
    }
    public saveToFile(String filename){
        //save Invoice in the file with given Name
    }
}

```

The above code can have bug since we are chaning the live code, It simply voilates the `Open-CLose Principle`.
for this we can make `interface InvoiceDao` with function `save`, to save into DB or file we can implements the `interface InvoiceDao`

```java
interface InvoiceDao{
    public void save(Invoice invoice);
}

```

```java
class DatabaseInvoiceDao implements InvoiceDao{

    //overriding the function of 'InvoiceDao`
    @override
    public void save(Invoice invoice){
        //save to DB
    }
}
```

```java
class FileInvoiceDao implements InvoiceDao{

     //overriding the function of 'InvoiceDao`
    @override
    public void save(Invoice invoice){
        //save to the file
    }
}
```

### 3. Liskov Substitution Pricincple

If class B is sub-type of class A, then we should be able to replace object of A with B, without breaking the behaviour of the program.

Subclass should extends the capibility of parents class, not narrow it down.

so we have class A and class B which extend from class A, There is programm which takes the input as a Object, if we give the input Object of class A , some output will be there,
if we give input as object of class B then it should also give some output(o/p may be different that's Okay) but it should not break the programm.

Let see the Example of Bike and MotorBike and Bicycle

```java
interface Bike{
    void turnOnEngine();
    void accelerate();
}

```

```java
class MotorCycle implements Bike{
    boolean isEngineOn;
    int speed;

    public void turnOneEngine(){
    //turn on the engine
     isEngineOn = true;
    }

    public void accelerate(){
        //accelerate the speed
        speed = speed + 100;
    }
}
```

At this point above code work like, if start the engine then it will start and also speed will be accelerated

Lets take another class `Bicyle`

```java

class Bicyle implements Bike{

     public void turnOneEngine(){
         throw new AssertionError("There is no engine");
         //this code alter the behaviour of the program, this is narrow down the feature of parent class Bike
    }

    public void accelerate(){
        //accelerate the speed
    }

}
```

### 4. Interface Segmented Principle

Interfaces should such, client should not implements unneccessary functions which they don't needed

suppose there is Restaurants , where waiters can serve the food or take an order only, it should not do any other task such as cooking food, washing dished.

```java
interface RestaurantEmployee{
    void washDishes();
    void serverCustomers();
    void cookFood();
}

```

```java
class Waiter implements RestaurantEmployee{
    public void washDishes(){
        //not my job
    }
    public void serverCustomers(){
        system.out.println("serving the food");
    }
    public void cookFood(){
        //not my job
    }
}
```

The above code is inheriting the interface `RestaurantEmployee` which automatically implements `waiter` class, this class have all three method of of parents class.

only one function is useful here for the `waiter` class, rest method are redudants.

To manage this things we should make different Interfaces so that class should inhertired from that particular Interfaces.

Instead of `RestaurantEmployee` interface we will make different interfaces like `WaiterInterface` and `ChefInterface`

See the below code.

```java
interface WaiterInterface{
    void serveCustomers();
    void takeOrdere();
}
```

```java
interface ChefInterface{
    void cookFood();
    void decideMenu();
}
```

```java
interface CleanerInterface{
    void washDishes();
}
```

```java
class Waiter implements WaiterInterface{
    public void  serveCustomers(){
        system.out.println("serving the food!");
    }
   public void takeOrdere(){
        system.out.println("Taking an Order sir!");
   }

}
```

### 5. Dependency Inversion

class should depends on the `Interfaces` rather than concrete `classes`

suppose we have two things here. 1. `interface Keybaord` , class `WiredKeyboard` and `BluetoothKeyboard` are inherting from the interface `Keyboard`, these two classes are called concrete class.

also consider the example of `Mouse`

```java
class MackBook{
    private final WiredKeyboard keyboard;
    private final WiredMouse mouse;

    public MackBook(){
        keyboard = new WiredKeyboard();
        mouse = new WiredMouse();
    }
}
```

In the above code `By declaring the WiredKeyboard and WiredMouse with the new keyword, we've tightly coupled these three classes together(MackBook, WiredKeyboard, WiredMouse classes).`

in-future we wanted to make our `MackBook` having `Bluetooth` then we can't do this because these are tightly coupled.

To solve this make two different interfaces of `Keyboards` and `Mouse`

Keyboard Interface

```java
public interface Keyboard{}
```

Mouse Interface

```java
public interface Mouse{}
```

MackBook class with object of interface `Keyboard` and `Mouse`

```java
class MackBook{
    private final Keyboard keyboard;
    private final Mouse mouse;

//constructor injection, here we can also send wired keyboard or mouse , also Bluetooth one
//here we can send any combination either wired or BT or Nearby
    public MacBook( Keyboard keyboard,  Mouse mouse){
        this.keyboard = keyboard;
        this.mouse = mouse;
    }
}

```
