#### Problem ?

There is NewsChannel who want to send the notification for every news, to those reader who have subscribed to this `NewsChannel`.

So there is Newschannel which is `Obserable` so when the state of `Obserable` changes then all the reader i.e `Observer` get notified every time new News came.

The relation between `Obserable` and `Observer` will be `one to many` so in OOP we can say its `Has a` relation.

Simple solution for this Problem is

#### Concrete Class

> suppose we created new `child class` from it `parents` class and we want all the method and properties of parent class then this `child class` can be called `concrete class`.
