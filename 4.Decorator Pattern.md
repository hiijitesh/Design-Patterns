### Problem?

Class Explosion

we added one layer to base class and make new class, again we did this and made new class so in this way we would have lots of classes, which leads to `Class Explosion`.

To solve this Problem `Decorator Pattern` came into the picture.

### Why We need this?

TO add the extra feature to the existing class
`Design Coffee Machine`
